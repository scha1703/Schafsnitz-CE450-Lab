## 2.2 Activity lifecycle and state

This lesson taught me about the different Activity states within an app. It showcased how Activities are created and destroyed often with simple configuration changes such as rotating the screen. These Activity resets can clear user data at unexpected times, so the lesson implements how to save states before the Activity is destroyed and how to restore a state when an Activity is created.  

## Issues and Lessons
