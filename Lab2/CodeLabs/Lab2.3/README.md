## 2.3 Implicit Intents

This lesson taught me about created implicit intents for other apps. In the lesson I designed an app that opens a browser to a specific site, opens maps to a specific location, and shares text to a selected app. I also learned how to make an app that handles implicit intents rather than just sending them.
