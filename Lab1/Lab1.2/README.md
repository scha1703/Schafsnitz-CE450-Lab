## 1.2 Your first interactive UI & The layout editor
 
This lesson introduced me to adding buttons and onClick event handlers in addition to simple UI management. This was the basics for any app development. The second portion of the lesson focused on different layout styles to accomodate different devices.  
## Issues and Lessons
 
The was on typo in the lesson. Part B, Task 2, Step 7. The instructions reference layout_width twice when the second one should be layout_height.
