# CE-450/650 Lab 1 (2019 Spring)
---
This repository is for Lab 1 part 1 submission.
 
## 1.1 Android Studio and Hello World
 
This section was an intro to the Android Development software. In this lesson I learned how to create a simple "Hello World" app and test the app using the emulator and a physical device.  
## Issues and Lessons
 
Some small issues I ran into during this lesson: At first I didn't have Hardware Acceleration enabled in the BIOS. Then I needed the appropriate drivers for my Android device. 
 
- Must enable hardware acceleration in BIOS to use emulator
- Must download device drivers
- Drivers located in `C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\extras`
