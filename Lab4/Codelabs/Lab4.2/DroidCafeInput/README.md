# CE-450/650 Lab 4 (2019 Spring)

This repository is for Lab 4 lesson 4.2 of Codelabs submission.
 
## 4.2 Input controls

This lesson expanded on the previous lab, adding more features such as using android:inputType to enter in form-like information. I also implemented several EditText types. This lesson taught me how to add radio buttons, and spinner input control.
