# CE-450/650 Lab 4 (2019 Spring)
---
This repository is for Lab 4 lesson 4.4 of Codelabs submission.
 
## 4.4 User Navigation

This lesson showed me how to create an app for tab navigation that shows three tabs below the app bar to navigate to sibling screens. When the user taps a tab, the screen shows a content screen, depending on which tab the user tapped. The user can also swipe left and right to visit the content screens.
