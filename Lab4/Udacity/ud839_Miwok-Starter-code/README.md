## Multiscreen Apps

This lesson showed me how to create an app using with multiple screens. I created an app to translate Miwok to English. It started with simple intents and activities, to navigate between screens. Then data was added to the screens with Arrays, Lists, and custom classes. Later I added, images and other visuals to improve the overall look of the app. Last I used Activity Lifecycle management to determine the action of activites when losing focus. I also added audio files of the miwok pronunciation.
