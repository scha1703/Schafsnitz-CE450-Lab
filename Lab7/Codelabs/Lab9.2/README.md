This repository is for Lab 7 lesson 9.2 of Codelabs submission.
 
## 9.2 App settings

In this lesson, I built an app named AppWithSettings using the Basic Activity template, and wihch has a settings Activity that provides one toggle switch setting that the user can turn on or off. The action displays a Toast message with the value of the setting. From this lesson I've learned how to add a Fragment for managing settings, how to create an XML resource file of settings with their attributes, how to create navigation to the settings Activity, how to set the default values of settings, how to read the settings values changed by the user, how to customize the Settings Activity template.
