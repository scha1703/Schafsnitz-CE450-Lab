# CE-450/650 Lab 7 (2019 Spring)

This repository is for Lab 7 lesson 9.1 of Codelabs submission.
 
## 9.1 Shared preferences

In this lesson, I built an app that includes buttons to increment the number, to change the background color, and to reset both the number and color to their defaults. The app also uses themes and styles to define the buttons. Through this lesson I've learned how to identify what shared preferences are, how to create a shared preferences file for your app, how to save data to shared preferences and read those preferences back again, and how to clear the data in the shared preferences.

## Issues and Lessons
