This repository is for Lab 7 lesson 8.1 of Codelabs submission.
 
## 8.1 Notifications

In this lesson, I built Notify Me! which is an app that lets the user trigger, update, and cancel a notification using three buttons. Through this lesson I've learned how to create a notification using the notification builder, how to use pending intents to respond to notification actions, and how to update or cancel existing notifications.

## Issues and Lessons
 
There were no issues during this lesson.
