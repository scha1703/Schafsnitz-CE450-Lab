# CE-450/650 Lab 7 (2019 Spring)
---
This repository is for Lab 7 lesson 9.2 of Codelabs submission.
 
## 9.2.2 App settings

In this lesson, I built an app that added the standard Settings Activity template provided by Android Studio to the DroidCafeOptionsUp app created in a previous lesson. The Settings Activity template is pre-populated with settings you can customize for an app, and provides a different layout for phones and tablets. From this lesson I've learned how to add a Fragment for managing settings, how to create an XML resource file of settings with their attributes, how to create navigation to the settings Activity, how to set the default values of settings, how to read the settings values changed by the user, how to customize the Settings Activity template.
