## Lesson 2: Using a Database in an Android App
In this lesson, I built an app that records the populator in a pet shelter. This app stores pets with their name, breed, weight, and gender. This app uses SQLite to store the information. I've learned how to interact with databases using a Contract class and Cursor objects. 

## Issues and Lessons
 
There were no issues during this lesson.
