# CE-450/650 Lab 6 (2019 Spring)
---
This repository is for Lab 6 lesson 7.1 of Codelabs submission.
 
## 7.1 AsyncTask

In this lesson, I built an app that has one TextView and one Button. When the user clicks the Button, the app sleeps for a random amount of time, and then displays a message in the TextView when it wakes up. This is done using an AsyncTask. 

## Issues and Lessons
 
There were no issues during this lesson.
