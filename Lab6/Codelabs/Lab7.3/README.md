This repository is for Lab 6 lesson 7.3 of Codelabs submission.
 
## 7.3 Broadcast receivers

In this lesson, I built an app that will register a BroadcastReceiver that displays a toast message when the device is connected or disconnected from power. The app will also send and receive a custom broadcast to display a different toast message.

## Issues and Lessons
 
There were no issues during this lesson.
