This repository is for Lab 6 lesson 7.2 of Codelabs submission.
 
## 7.2 AsyncTask and AsyncTaskLoader

In this lesson, I built an app that contains an EditText and a Button. The user enters the name of a book in the EditText and taps the button. The button executes an AsyncTask that queries the Google Books API to find the author and title of the book the user is looking for. The results are retrieved and displayed in a TextView below the button.
